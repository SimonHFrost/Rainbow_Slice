Hobby game I'm working on that can be seen [here](http://www.rainbowslice.com).

TODO:
-----

* syntax consistency - strings, function declarations
* requirejs
* lightweight testing suite
* change bullet.used and enemy.isDead hacks
* consistent way of using my own classes with three.js classes (className.threeObject?)
* if (this.sceneInitializer.sceneObjects.movement.isMoving) { in main.js
* just use one clock
* consistent way to access updatableObjects
* consistent params assigned to local variables
* shouldn't have to pass sceneObjects into any classes instantiated in sceneObjects
* reduce constructor params enemy.js
