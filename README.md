TODO:
-----

* syntax consistency - strings, function declarations
* requirejs (maybe)
* lightweight testing suite
* change bullet.used and enemy.isDead hacks
* shouldn't have to pass sceneObjects into any classes instantiated in sceneObjects
* reduce constructor params enemy.js
* reduce constructor params enemySpawner.js
* reduce class sizes
* reduce method sizes
* all scene additions in sceneObjects apart from enemySpawner
