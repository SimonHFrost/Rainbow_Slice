TODO:
-----

syntax consistency - strings, function declarations
requirejs
lightweight testing suite
fix bullet.used and enemy.isDead hacks
consistent way of using my own classes with three.js classes (className.threeObject?)
camera needs to be instantiated before player in SceneObjects.js
initSceneObjects needs to be before SceneObjects() because it needs the island vectors
if (this.sceneInitializer.sceneObjects.movement.isMoving) { in main.js
just use one clock
